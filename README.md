# Consulting-Project-Decorative-Lighting-Industry
This is a consulting project I did for class credit. WakaNINE is a decorative lighting company based in Austin, TX and their ask was to make recommendations for their marketing team to implement a data-driven approach to the lighting specificaiton process.


## 1. Introduction

### Stakeholders

#### wakaNINE's marketing team
CEO John Cooke
David Truebridge
Marketing Team

#### Suppliers and Manufacturer’s Representatives 
WakaNINE distributes lighting fixtures from four suppliers— ANGO, David Truebridge, TRK, and PLN Group. Each of these suppliers handles their own manufacturing, and together with wakaNINE, they work with manufacturer’s representatives to showcase and sell their fixtures to design firms. These are independent companies who have exclusive representation of a product line in designated US regions. For example, the manufacturer’s representative for wakaNINE products in Central Texas is Legacy Lighting. Manufacturer’s representatives need to have solid relationships with design firms, since they meet directly with design professionals to sell the fixtures. During normal times this involved showing light fixtures in person, usually at pop-up events in major cities and regional trade shows. Recently, they have been participating in virtual trade shows.

### Property Developers annd Design Firms
Property developers contract architecture and design firms to make plans for a building. Architecture firms must design for safety, compliance to regulations, energy efficiency, and environmental credentials of the entire building. WakaNINE is targeting all levels of architects. 
In the interior design field, wakaNINE is targeting all levels of interior designers, and lighting designers, and acoustic designers, when it comes to their HUSH line. Interior designers are involved with all aspects of designing an interior space, including lighting and acoustics. Lighting designers are professionals who focus specifically on the natural light and lighting systems controls of a building. 

## The Ask

The elements that will make for a successful response to the ask include developing a quantifiable and easily implemented strategy for increasing influence in the specification process.  

## Data Collection

We distributed a survey composed of 18 questions, including free response, rating, and multiple choice questions. We recieved 106 responses in 4 days. As a team, we conducted a total of 9 Zoom interviews with professionals in the design industry with the goal of gaining context on the specification process before analyzing our survey data. The data that we collected from our interviews was unstructured qualitative data in the form of interview transcripts. With most of the primary data we collected being qualitative, 

## Prepare and Process Data

The survey responses were a spreadsheet with 106 rows. 

- Pivot table to get counts "for "how did you find wakaNINE", "When are you most actively looking for information on products"
- made a copy of the 'Form Responses' sheet to work with while keeping the original 
- added a column named "Role Category" and manually classified the self-reported "firm and role category" into 7 role classifications - 
- counted number of respondents in each role category with the COUNTIF formula =countif('Form Responses-Copy'!F:F,A2) 
- split responses to "What could lighting manufacturers improve to make your role in specifying fixtures easier?" by commas using the Data tab in Excel 
- copied columns containg responses to "When selecting a lighting fixture for a new project, please rank the following attributes from most to least important in making your decision from 1 to 5. (5 being the most important attribute)" into a new sheet called 'Most Important Attributes'
- created table of counts of respondents ratings of each attribute using COUNTIF. The rows were the 5 attributes and the columns were 5 ranking categores.
- COUNTIF('Full Most Important Attributes'!$C:$C, 1)

## Analyze

### Survey Sample Representation

Interior designers were the most represented in our survey sample, making up over half of our responses. The next most represented roles were lighting designers, making up about 15% of our responses. Architects and sales people made up 11% and 6% of our responses respectively. The “Other” category  includes project managers, property developers, marketing specialists, controls engineers, and electrical engineers. Another 6% of the respondents did not specify their role in the specification process, though some of them stated that they were principals in their firm (but did not specify the name of their firm)

We can see that the most important attribute is Client, while the least important attribute is Company mission...
